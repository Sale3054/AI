    "Well, it turns out Snake lived through his perilous trip to New York City.  He returned to Chicago, where he is living happily among the criminals, sea lions and criminal sea lions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because Snake has traveled across the country already, he has some prior knowledge regarding how far various cities along the way are from his final destination of Providence.  In particular, Snake maps out the **straight-line distance** from major cities to Providence. This information is displayed graphically below, on a tattoo on Kurt Russell's forearm (you can't prove that isn't true), and in the `sld_providence` dictionary in the [helper functions](#helper) at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that because it doesn't make much sense to add estimated travel times and the straight-line distance, we will only be using the `map_distances` state space graph for this problem.\n",

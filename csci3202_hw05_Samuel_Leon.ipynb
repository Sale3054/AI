    "The following Bayesian network is based loosely on a study that examined heart disease risk factors in 167 elderly individuals in South Carolina.  This study is [linked here](https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/jc4v74a5uu5wa/jeyiv7kvs7r7ck) and posted to Piazza under the Resources tab.  Note that this figure uses Y and N to represent Yes and No, whereas in class we used the equivalent T and F to represent True and False Boolean values.\n",

Below are the codes for the (conditional) probability `P` function and `BayesNode` class as well, that we used in class on Friday (16 March) to represent the variable nodes and calculate probabilities. You can code this however you want, subject to the following constraints:\n",
    "1. the nodes are represented using the `BayesNode` class and can work with the `P` function for probabilities,\n",
